# Comprehensive Styling Guide

## **JavaScript**

**General Formatting:**

* Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces are common, avoid tabs).
* Use spaces around operators (e.g., `+ - * /`).
* Add spaces after commas (`,`).
* Separate function calls with commas and spaces (e.g., `functionA(arg1, arg2)`).
* Use consistent line length (e.g., 80 characters).

**Variable Naming:**

* Use descriptive and meaningful names (e.g., `wordContainer` instead of `wc`).
* Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `checkWin`).
* Use UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `MAX_CHANCES`).

**Comments:**

* Use single-line comments (`//`) for short explanations.
* Use multi-line comments (`/* ... */`) for complex logic or describing sections.
* Start comments with a capital letter and avoid ending with a period.

**Whitespace:**

* Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.
* Avoid unnecessary whitespace.

**Semicolons:**

* Include semicolons at the end of most statements (except variable declarations).
* Use automatic semicolon insertion tools to avoid semicolon-related errors.

**Braces:**

* Use curly braces (`{}`) even for single-line statements in functions (enforces consistency).

**String Formatting:**

* Use single quotes (`'`) for strings unless they contain single quotes (use double quotes then, `"`).
* Consider using template literals (backticks ``) for complex string formatting with variables.

**Best Practices:**

* Utilize `const` and `let` for variable declarations based on mutability needs.
* Favor descriptive variable names over short abbreviations.
* Break down complex functions into smaller, reusable functions.
* Use meaningful error messages to aid debugging.
* Consider using a linter or code formatter to enforce these guidelines automatically.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided code uses some shorthand conditional expressions for choosing words based on screen size. Consider using a dedicated function for clarity if this logic becomes more complex.
* The code utilizes event listeners for keyboard interaction. Ensure proper event handling practices (e.g., prevent default behavior when necessary).

By following these guidelines, you can improve the readability, maintainability, and consistency of your JavaScript code. Remember, style guides are meant to be flexible and can be adapted to your specific project needs and team preferences.
